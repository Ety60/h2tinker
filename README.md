# H2Tinker

H2Tinker is a minimalistic low-level HTTP/2 client implementation.

It is based on [scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy) and also enables directly sending scapy-crafted frames. On top of scapy, h2tinker provides
* HTTP/2 connection setup and management,
* TCP and TLS connection setup and management,
* a user-friendly documented and typed API for creating different frames and requests,
* documentation and examples on how different attacks can be implemented.

See [Examples](https://github.com/kspar/h2tinker/wiki/Examples) to get started.
